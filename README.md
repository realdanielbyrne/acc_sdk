## Introduction

The Autodesk Construction Cloud SDK, AccSdk, is a software development kit for Python that helps developers
create applications that leverage the [Autodesk Construction Cloud API](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/autodesk-construction-cloud).
This SDK grew out of my company's need to automate certain aspects of ACC that are not currently supported by the
[ACC web application](https://acc.autodesk.com/).

Autodesk publishes and maintains an extensive collection of APIs that allow you to automate and integrate across all of their platform
products, ACC being one of their newer offerings. The official documentation for the ACC API can be found at
[Autodesk Construction Cloud API](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/autodesk-construction-cloud). This package
also supports a subset of the [Data Management API](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/data-management-api),
which provides access to the data stored in the ACC Files module. Please refer to the original documentation for extensive details
on the API endpoints and their usage.

This package is not an official Autodesk product, but rather a community-driven effort to provide an alternative
interface to the ACC API. Specifically, I've used this package to automate setting up hundreds of jobs and users in
ACC when the company I work for first adopted the platform. We also use this package on an ongoing basis to automate adding
new hires and managing bulk user updates to large numbers of projects. For instance, when someone gets promoted, we upgrade
their project level permissions and possibly add them to a larger subset of the overall projects. I've also used this package in an automation script
that creates new projects in ACC as new projects get created in an adjacent ERP application. There are many more uses. Feel free to contribute to the project
by adding more services or features, and/or sending me a message if you have any questions or suggestions for future enhancements.

## Features

AccSdk currently implements the following Autodesk Construction Cloud APIs:

- The Account Users API allows you to add and update groups of users to your account.
- The Authentication API provides methods to authenticate with the ACC using the OAuth2 2-legged and/or the 3-legged flows.
 This class also maintains the validity of the Bearer tokens by refreshing the tokens as they expire, and manages both
 2-legged and 3-legged tokens at the same time to give you full access to the API services.
- The Business Units API allows you to create, update, or get business units in your account.
- The Companies API provides methods to manage companies, such as adding and updating companies.
- The Data Management API allows you to manage files and folders in the project. You can upload, download, and
 delete files, create folders, and move files between folders. The API also provides access to the data stored
 in the ACC Data Management module.
- The Forms API provides methods to securely create forms from a template, fill out, modify, and retrieve form data.
- The Project Users API provides methods to manage project users, such as adding, updating, deleting, and patching permissions for users on a project.
- The Projects API provides methods to create, read, update, and delete projects.
- The Sheets API provides methods to manage sheets and version sets, as well as uploading, publishing, and exporting sheets as PDFs.
- The User Profile API provides a method for gathering profile information from the logged-in user.
- The Photos API provides methods to retrieve and search for photos.
- The Data Connector API provides methods to initiate and manage bulk data downloads which can then be used in analysis tools like PowerBI and Tableau.

## Basic Usage

### Authentication

The first step in using the AccSdk, you need to create an instance of the `ACC` class. The `ACC` class provides access to the various
services provided by the ACC API.  However, first you need to authenticate with the ACC API.

The AccSdk Authentication module implements methods to use the the OAuth2 2-legged and 3-legged authentication processes, and it
manages the tokens and their liftimes. The Authentication module class provides the necessary methods to

- Authenticate with the ACC API using
  - 2 legged OAuth Client Credential flow
  - 3 legged OAuth Authorization Code flow
- Maintain the validity of tokens, by refreshing them as they expire
- Manage both 2-legged and 3-legged tokens concurrently to give you full access to the API services
- Revoke tokens
- Introspect tokens to check their validity
- Logout of the 3-legged session
- Get the user profile of the 3-legged token holder
- Get the OpenID Connect Discovery Document
- Get the APIs supported scopes

The initialization of the `Authentication` class requires the following parameters:

- `session`: A Flask session or a Python dictionary that is used to store the tokens and other session-related data.
- `client_id`: The Client ID of your application. This is provided by Autodesk when you register your application.
- `client_secret`: The client secret of your application. This is also provided by Autodesk when you register your application. Optional if you are using PKCE.
- `admin_email`: The email address of the token holder user. Optional for 2-legged. Used for user_impersonation.
- `callback_url`: The callback URL that Autodesk will redirect to after the user has authenticated. Required for the 3-legged flow.
- `login_url`: The login URL for the 3-legged flow. This is the URL that Autodesk will redirect to after the user has authenticated. Optional.

The following code snippet shows how to authenticate with the ACC API using the 2 legged client credential flow.

See [tests/test_2legged.py](tests/test_2legged.py) for a full example.


```python
import os
from acc_sdk import Authentication # Authentication Module for managing the authentication process and tokens
from acc_sdk import Acc

from dotenv import load_dotenv # for optionally loading environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Load your environment variables
ACCOUNT_ID = os.environ.get('AUTODESK_ACCOUNT_ID')
CLIENT_ID =  os.environ.get('AUTODESK_CLIENT_ID_WEB_APP'),
CLIENT_SECRET =  os.environ.get('AUTODESK_CLIENT_SECRET_WEB_APP')
ADMIN_EMAIL = os.environ.get("ADMIN_EMAIL")


auth_client = Authentication( session={}, client_id=CLIENT_ID, client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET, admin_email="youremail@adomain.com")

# Define the scopes you want your token holder to have,

scopes = [
            "user-profile:read",
            "viewables:read",
            "data:read",
            "data:write",
            "account:read",
            "account:write"
            ]

# Optionaly query the OpenID Connect Discovery Document to get the API's supported scopes
spec = auth_client.get_oidc_spec()
scopes_supported = spec["scopes_supported"]
scopes = [
    scope
    for scope in scopes_supported
    if scope.startswith("data")
    or scope.startswith("account")
    or scope.startswith("user-profile")
]

# Request the 2 legged token
auth_client.request_2legged_token(scopes=scopes)
assert auth_client._session["accapi_2legged"]
```

The following code snippet shows a simplified example on how to authenticate using the 3 legged authorization code flow.

See [tests/test_3legged.py](tests/test_3legged.py) for a full example.

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect, url_for, session
from acc_sdk import Authentication, Acc

load_dotenv()

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = os.environ.get("FLASK_SESSION_KEY")
app.config["SESSION_TYPE"] = "filesystem"
app.config["SESSION_FILE_DIR"] = ".flask_session"
Session(app)

CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get("AUTODESK_CLIENT_ID_WEB_APP")
CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get("AUTODESK_CLIENT_SECRET_WEB_APP")
ADMIN_EMAIL = os.environ.get("ADMIN_EMAIL")
CALLBACK_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/callback"
ACCOUNT_ID = os.environ.get("AUTODESK_ACCOUNT_ID")
SCOPES = [ "user-profile:read","user:read","user:write","viewables:read","data:read","data:write","data:create","account:read","account:write"]

    """
    email = request.form.get("email")
    session["user_email"] = email
    auth = Authentication(
        session=session,
        client_id=CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
        admin_email=session["user_email"],
        callback_url=CALLBACK_URL,
    )

    authorization_url = auth.get_authorization_url(scopes=SCOPES)
    return redirect(authorization_url)

@app.route("/callback", methods=["GET"])
def callback():
    """

    Redirects to dashboard if successful, or an error message if not.
    """
    code = request.args.get("code")
    if not code:
        return "No authorization code received.", 400

    # Rebuild the Authentication object from the session to retain the same user context
    auth = Authentication(
        session=session,

    token_data = auth.request_authcode_access_token(code=code, scopes=SCOPES)
    if not token_data:
        return "Failed to exchange code for token", 400

    return redirect(url_for("dashboard"))

@app.route("/dashboard", methods=["GET"])
def dashboard():
    """ Final destination of 3 legged Authenticatin flow. """

    # Rebuild the Authentication object from the session to retain the same user context
    auth = Authentication(session,CLIENT_ID,CLIENT_SECRET, session["user_email"], CALLBACK_URL)

    # Build an ACC instance (acc_sdk) with the user's authentication context
    auth = Authentication(
        session=session,
        client_id=CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
        admin_email=session["user_email"],
        callback_url=CALLBACK_URL,
    )
    # Retrieve user’s projects
    active_build_projects_params = {
        "fields": "name,jobNumber,type",
        "filterTextMatch": "equals",
    }
    projects = acc.projects.get_all_active_projects(
        filter_params=active_build_projects_params
    )

    return render_template("dashboard.html", projects=projects)

def run():
    app.run(debug=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()

```

### Initialization

Once you have authenticated with the ACC API, you can create an instance of the `ACC` class. The `ACC` class provides access to the various services provided by the ACC API. The account id is an optional argument. If you do not provide the account id, the class will attempt to get the Account Id from the 2-legged token.  Not providing the account id will not limit the services you can access if you have both the 2-legged and 3-legged tokens and the appropriate scopes.

```python
from acc_sdk import Acc
acc = Acc(auth_client=auth_client, account_id=ACCOUNT_ID)
```

The account id is an optional argument. If you do not provide the account id, the class will attempt to get the Account Id from the 2-legged token.  Not providing the account
id will not limit the APIs you can access. Best is to provide both 2-legged and 3-legged tokens in the Authentication class with and the appropriate scopes so that
you can access all the APIs.

## Making API Requests

Making API requests is simple. You can access the various services provided by the ACC API by calling the appropriate method on the `ACC` class. Detailed documentation for each API is available in separate files.
